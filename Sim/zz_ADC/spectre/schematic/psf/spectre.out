Warning from spectre.
    WARNING (SPECTRE-16707): Only tran supports psfxl format, result of other analyses will be in psfbin format.


************************************************
Transient Analysis `tran': time = (0 s -> 10 us)
************************************************

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(I2.I18.MN6.m1:int_s) = 67.9801 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.
