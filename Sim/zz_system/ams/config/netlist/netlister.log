INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/home/cc/ee140/fa19/class/ee140-abc/Documents/ee240-project/Sim/zz_system/ams/config/netlist/digital/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name
mapped table, set 
simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or
the .simrc file 
before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
INFO (AMS-2150): Generating the 'changedVarsSummary' file in the 'netlist'
directory. This file prints the values of the netlister control variables, which
are different from their default values. To disable the file creation, type
'envSetVal("ams.netlisterOpts" "print_control_vars" 'boolean nil )' in the
'.cdsinit' file.

INFO (VLOGNET-117): Re-netlisting the entire design.

INFO (VLOGNET-118): Using connection by name (explicit connections) for all
stopping and 
non-stopping cells.
 
WARNING (VLOGNET-199): An explicit netlist for cellview
'final_project/mux/schematic' cannot be generated because either split buses or
bundle terminals are present in it.
 Therefore, an implicit netlist for this
instance has been generated. 

WARNING (VLOGNET-199): An explicit netlist for cellview
'final_project/system/schematic' cannot be generated because either split buses
or bundle terminals are present in it.
 Therefore, an implicit netlist for this
instance has been generated. 

WARNING (VLOGNET-105): Cannot drop port ranges because the cell
'final_project/system/schematic' has split busses 
across module ports.
Therefore, ignoring the flag simVerilogDropPortRange.
 
WARNING (VLOGNET-110): The cell 'final_project/zz_system/schematic' has no
ports. Make sure that this was the intended 
design.
